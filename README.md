## About

ericw-tools is a branch of Tyrann's quake 1 tools, focused on
adding lighting features, mostly borrowed from q3map2. There are a few
bugfixes for qbsp as well. Original readme follows:

A collection of command line utilities for building Quake levels and working
with various Quake file formats. I need to work on the documentation a bit
more, but below are some brief descriptions of the tools.

Included utilities:

 - qbsp    - Used for turning a .map file into a playable .bsp file.

 - light   - Used for lighting a level after the bsp stage. This util was previously known as TyrLite

 - vis     - Creates the potentially visible set (PVS) for a bsp.

 - bspinfo - Print stats about the data contained in a bsp file.

 - bsputil - Simple tool for manipulation of bsp file data

See the doc/ directory for more detailed descriptions of the various
tools capabilities.  See changelog.md for a brief overview of recent
changes or https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools for the full changelog and
source code.

## Compiling

Dependencies: Embree 3.0+, TBB (TODO: version?), Sphinx (for building manuals)

### Ubuntu

NOTE: Builds using Ubuntu's embree packages produce a significantly slower `light` (i.e. over twice as slow) than ones released on Embree's GitHub. See `build-linux-64.sh` for a better method. 

```
sudo apt install libembree-dev libtbb-dev cmake build-essential g++
sudo apt install python3-pip
python3 -m pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
export PATH="~/.local/bin/:$PATH"
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools
cd ericw-tools
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

### Windows

Example using vcpkg (32-bit build):

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools
cd ericw-tools

# creates a python virtual environment in the directory `sphinx-venv`
# and install sphinx (for building the docs)
py.exe -m venv sphinx-venv
.\sphinx-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py.exe -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

# NOTE: vcpkg builds for 32-bit by default
# NOTE: takes 30+ minutes
.\vcpkg\vcpkg install embree3
mkdir build
cd build

# PowerShell syntax for getting current directory -
# otherwise, replace with absolute path to "vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$(pwd)/../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=Win32 -DSPHINX_EXECUTABLE="$(pwd)/../sphinx-venv/Scripts/sphinx-build.exe"
```

#### IDE Tips - CLion

- Modify the "Google Test" run/debug configuration template to have `--gtest_catch_exceptions=0`, otherwise the  
  debugger doesn't stop on exceptions (segfaults etc.)

  (see: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-29559/Clion-LLDB-does-not-break-on-SEH-exceptions-within-GTest)

### macOS 10.15

```
brew install embree tbb
python3 -m pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools
cd ericw-tools
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -GXcode -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix embree);$(brew --prefix tbb)"
```
