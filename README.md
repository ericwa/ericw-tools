## About

ericw-tools is a branch of Tyrann's quake 1 tools, focused on
adding lighting features, mostly borrowed from q3map2. There are a few
bugfixes for qbsp as well. Original readme follows:

A collection of command line utilities for building Quake levels and working
with various Quake file formats. I need to work on the documentation a bit
more, but below are some brief descriptions of the tools.

Included utilities:

 - qbsp    - Used for turning a .map file into a playable .bsp file.

 - light   - Used for lighting a level after the bsp stage. This util was previously known as TyrLite

 - vis     - Creates the potentially visible set (PVS) for a bsp.

 - bspinfo - Print stats about the data contained in a bsp file.

 - bsputil - Simple tool for manipulation of bsp file data

See the doc/ directory for more detailed descriptions of the various
tools capabilities.  See changelog.txt for a brief overview of recent
changes or https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools for the full changelog and
source code.
