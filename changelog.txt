2017-09-17 TyrUtils-ericw 0.15.11

- qbsp: fix CSG issue with overlapping off grid brushes (https://github.com/ericwa/tyrutils-ericw/issues/174)
- qbsp: fix HOMs introduced in 0.15.10, which were caused by an attempt to fix leaks-through-solids in 0.15.10.
        To re-enable the buggy code that may fix leaks through solids but add HOMs, use "-contenthack" 
        (https://github.com/ericwa/tyrutils-ericw/issues/175).

2017-07-30 TyrUtils-ericw 0.15.10

- light: add "_shadowworldonly" bmodel key - only cast shadows on world, not other bmodels.

- light: handle degenerate faces, print out the vertex coordinates
- qbsp: misc_external_map prefab system (see qbsp manual)

2017-06-10 TyrUtils-ericw 0.15.10-beta2

- light: styled lights no longer bounce by default, set "_bouncestyled" "1" to enable.
- qbsp: map format conversion: fix reversing of epairs in converted maps
- qbsp: func_detail rewrite to fix vis issues with previous version.
        func_detail no longer seals maps.
- qbsp: add -omitdetail to omit all func_detail entities from the compile
- qbsp: new func_detail_illusionary entity. func_detail variant with no collision
        (players / monsters / gunfire) and doesn't split world faces.
        Doesn't cast shadows unless enabled with "_shadow" "1".
        Useful for hanging vines. Still creates BSP leafs. (Possible
        enhancement: avoid creating new leafs and just insert marksurfaces into
        existing leafs?)
- qbsp: new func_detail_wall entity. func_detail variant that doesn't split
        world faces. Useful for when you want a decoration touching a floor or wall
        to not split the floor/wall faces (you'll get some overdraw instead.)
        If it completely covers up a world face, that face will get clipped away, so
        it's not suitable for fence textures; see func_detail_fence instead.
- qbsp: new func_detail_fence entity. Similar to func_detail_wall except 
        it's suitable for fence textures, never clips away world faces.
        Useful for fences, grates, etc., that are solid and block gunfire.
- qbsp: add -forceprt1 option to generate a .prt file that GTKRadiant's prtview
        plugin can load (but will be unusable by vis). 
        When func_detail is in use you normally get a PRT2 file that ptrview
        can't load.
- qbsp, light: allow _shadow -1 to stop a func_detail from casting shadows

2017-03-26 TyrUtils-ericw 0.15.10-beta1

- light: fix Linux binary
- light: lights with a lightstyle now bounce

2016-11-20 TyrUtils-ericw 0.15.9 release

- light: fix black fringes on bmodels that are touching against the world
- light: light passing through glass lights up the back side
- light: bmodels with "_alpha" < 1 and "_shadow" "1" set cast tinted shadows
- qbsp: support Quake 3 "Brush Primitives" .MAP format
- qbsp: save "_mincolor" for func_detail/group to the .texinfo file, now used by light 
- qbsp: performance improvements

2016-10-03 TyrUtils-ericw 0.15.8 release

- light: fix black noise in some cases when using -bounce. (reported by Pritchard)
- light: try to limit artifacts caused by "too many lightstyles on a face", 
         by saving the 4 brightest lightmaps. The previous behaviour was random,
         so you would likely get bad artifacts when that warning occurred.
- light: restore and expand the "unmatched target" warnings.
         Now checks "target", "killtarget", "target2", "angrytarget", "deathtarget".
         Also checks for any "targetname" that is never targetted.
- light: restore support for skip-textured bmodels with "_shadow" "1".
         This is only supported on bmodels where all faces are textured with "skip".
- light: add "_lightignore" model key, makes a model receive minlight only.
- qbsp:  accept absolute path to map (reported by lurq)

2016-09-09 TyrUtils-ericw 0.15.7 release

Bugfixes:

- light: fix shadow-casting bmodels that touch the world from messing up
         sample points on world faces, and prevent the world from messing up 
         bmodel sample points (regression in 0.15.5)
- light: clamp lightmap samples to 255 before smoothing, downscaling.
         reduces jaggies in cases with very bright lights casting hard shadows.
- light: fix order of "_project_mangle" value to be consistent with "mangle"
- light: various crash fixes
- light: minlight no longer bounces

Performance:

- light: new, faster raytracing backend (Embree)
- light: estimate visible bounding box each light by shooting rays in a sphere. 
         this gives a speedup similar to vised maps in 0.15.5, without requiring
         the map to be vised. As a downside, there is a small chance of 
         introducing artifacts where lights cut off too soon.
         Disable with "-novisapprox".
- light: bounce lighting code redesigned to use less memory

Other:

- all: windows builds now require MSVC 2013 runtime:
       https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=40784
- all: restore Windows XP support

- light: add "_sun2" "_sun2_color" "_sun2_mangle" which creates a second sun
         (unrelated to "_sunlight2" which is the sky dome light)
- vis: support .prt files written by bjptools-xt
- qbsp: add -objexport flag

Bugfixes:

- vis: fix ambient sounds when using func_detail, broken in tyrutils-ericw-v0.15.3

2015-12-10 TyrUtils-ericw 0.15.4 release

New features:

* light: new "-parse_escape_sequences" command-line flag. 
         The "\b" escape sequence toggles red text on/off, you can use this
         in any strings in the map file. 
         e.g. "message" "Here is \bsome red text\b..."
* light: new "-surflight_dump" command-line flag. Saves the lights generated
         by surfacelights to a "mapname-surflights.map" file.
* light: new "_sunlight3" and "_sunlight3_color" keys. Same as "_sunlight2", 
         except creates suns on the bottom hemispere ("_sunlight2" creates

other:

  phase.
* qbsp: MakeFaceEdges: accelerate with a hash table to avoid slow O(n^2) search

* light: MatchTargets: disable copying "style" key/value from a light to the
  entity that targets it. Don't see any point, and causes problems if "style"
  is meaningful for the targetting entity (e.g. a monster).
