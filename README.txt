A collection of command line utilities for building Quake levels and working
with various Quake file formats. I need to work on the documentation a bit
more, but below are some brief descriptions of the tools.

Included utilities:

  qbsp    - Used for turning a .map file into a playable .bsp file.

  light   - Used for lighting a level after the bsp stage.
            This util was previously known as TyrLite

  vis     - Creates the potentially visible set (PVS) for a bsp.

  bspinfo - Print stats about the data contained in a bsp file.

  bsputil - Simple tool for manipulation of bsp file data

See the doc/ directory for more detailed descriptions of the various
tools capabilities.  See changelog.txt for a brief overview of recent
changes or git://disenchant.net/tyrutils for the full changelog and
source code.
